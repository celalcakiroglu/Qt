 Tests of the Linear Least Squares routines

 LAPACK VERSION 3.4.2

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         6     0     5     8    10    30
    P:         0     5     5     5     8    20
    N:         5     5     6     8    12    40

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.222507-307
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.179769+309
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.111022D-15

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 ** On entry to ZGGLSE parameter number  1 had an illegal value
