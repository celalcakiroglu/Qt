 Tests of the Generalized Nonsymmetric Eigenvalue Problem Driver ZGGEV

 LAPACK VERSION 3.4.2

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         2     6     8    10    12    20
    N:         2     6     8    10    12    20
    NB:        1
    NBMIN:     1
    NX:        1
    NS:        2
    MAXB:      1

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.222507-307
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.179769+309
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.111022D-15

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   10.00


 ** On entry to ZGGES parameter number  1 had an illegal value
