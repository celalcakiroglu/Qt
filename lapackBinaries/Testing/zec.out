 Tests of the Nonsymmetric eigenproblem condition estimation routines
 ZTRSYL, ZTREXC, ZTRSNA, ZTRSEN

 Relative machine precision (EPS) =     0.222045D-15
 Safe minimum (SFMIN)             =     0.222507-307

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 ** On entry to ZTRSYL parameter number  1 had an illegal value
