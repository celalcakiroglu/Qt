 Tests of the Generalized Nonsymmetric Eigenvalue Problem Driver CGGEV

 LAPACK VERSION 3.4.2

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         2     6     8    10    12    20
    N:         2     6     8    10    12    20
    NB:        1
    NBMIN:     1
    NX:        1
    NS:        2
    MAXB:      1

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   10.00
